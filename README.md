INTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE
Programming is an essential part of data science. It’s also what sets data science apart from similar fields, like data analytics.

Programming is the practice of writing commands for a computer to execute. Computer Science is the discipline of interacting 
with computation systems.

A computer program is a series of instructions that tells the computer to perform a certain task. This could range from simply 
asking a computer to print, “Kirby has the best superpower!” to asking a computer to create a model that recommends movies based 
on your previous interests.

In data science, programming allows us to hand the processing power over to the computers. Given the right commands, computers 
can process millions of data points in a matter of seconds. In further Codecademy content, you will learn to write code that organizes 
and analyzes data. Furthermore, within data science, programs will allow you to reproduce experiments by simply running the program again.

You will also learn how to program models that can make predictions based on data points. These models are the basis of 
machine learning - a field of computer science that allows computers to make predictions based on data.
